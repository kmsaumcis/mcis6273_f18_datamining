<p>You are being encouraged to turn the assignment in using the provided
Jupyter Notebook.  To do so, make a directory in your Lab environment called
<code>homework/hw0</code>.   Put all of your files in that directory.  Then zip that directory,
rename it with your name as the first part of the filename (e.g. <code>maull_hw0_files.zip</code>), then
download it to your local machine, then upload the <code>.zip</code> to Blackboard.</p>

<p>If you do not know how to do this, please ask, or visit one of the many tutorials out there
on the basics of using zip in Linux.</p>

<h3 id="5-familiarize-yourself-with-the-jupyterlab-environment">(5%) Familiarize yourself with the JupyterLab environment</h3>

<p><a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter (https://jupyter.org)</a> is the core platform we will be using in this course and
is the platform of choice for data scientists around the world.  We have a JupyterLab
setup for this course so that we can operate in a cloud-hosted environment, free from
some of the resource contraints of running Jupyter on your local machine (though you are free to set
it up and seek my advice if you desire to do that).</p>

<p>The Jupyter envitonment we have setup can be found here <a href="https://js-16-117.jetstream-cloud.org/">https://js-16-117.jetstream-cloud.org/</a>.
<em>You must contact me directly (and immediately) for your login credentials.</em></p>

<p>We will be using the <a href="https://anaconda.com">Anaconda (https://anaconda.com)</a> distribution of Python for our course.</p>

<p>As you will soon find out Notebooks are an incredibly effective way to mix code with narrative
and you can create cells that are entirely code or entirely Markdown.  Markdown (MD or md) is
a highly readable text format that allows for easy documentation of text files, while allowing
for HTML-based rendering of the text in a way that is style-independent.</p>

<p>We will be using Markdown frequently in this course, and you will learn that there are many different
&ldquo;flavors&rdquo; or Markdown.  We will only be using the basic flavor, but you will benefit from exploring
the &ldquo;Github flavored&rdquo; Markdown, though you will not be responsible for using it in this course &ndash; on the
&ldquo;basic&rdquo; flavor.</p>

<p>&#167;  <strong>THERE IS NOTHING TO TURN IN FOR THIS PART.</strong> Play with and become familiar with the basic functions of the Lab environment at <a href="https://js-16-117.jetstream-cloud.org/">https://js-16-117.jetstream-cloud.org/</a>.</p>

<p>&#167;  <strong>PLEASE <em>TURN IN A MARKDOWN DOCUMENT</em> WITH 3 SENTENCES/FRAGMENTS THAT ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What do you wish to accomplish this semester in Data Mining?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Read the documentation for basic Markdown <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax">here</a>.
Turn in the text <code>.md</code> file <em>not</em> the processed <code>.html</code>.  In whatever you turn in,
you must show the use of <em>ALL</em> the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>headings (one level is fine),</li>
<li>bullets,</li>
<li>bold and italics</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, the content of your document needs to address the question above.  <strong>You will lose points</strong>  if you do not do that.</p>

<h3 id="5-familiarize-yourself-with-github-and-basic-git">(5%) Familiarize yourself with Github and basic git</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com">Github (https://github.com)</a> is the <em>de facto</em> platform for open source software in the world based
on the very popular <a href="https://git-scm.org">git (https://git-scm.org)</a> version control system. Git has a sophisticated set
of tools for version control based on the concept of local repositories for fast commits and remote
repositories only when collaboration and remote synchronization is necessary.  Github enhances git by providing
tools and online hosting of public and private repositories to encourage and promote sharing and collaboration.
Github hosts some of the world&rsquo;s most widely used open source software.</p>

<p><strong>If you are already familiar with git and Github, then this part will be very easy!</strong></p>

<p>&#167;  <strong>CREATE A GITHUB.COM ACCOUNT AND RECORD THE URL TO YOUR ACCOUNT.</strong>  It is OK if you already have an account,
record the account URL either way. Use your <code>.edu</code> email address &ndash; you will be able to get free private repositories
for as long as you are a student with that email address.  Enjoy this perk while you can &ndash; private repositories
start at around $7/month when you are no longer using the <code>.edu</code> address.  Public repositories are always free.</p>

<p>&#167;  <strong>CREATE A PUBLIC GITHUB REPO NAME <code>&quot;MyDataSci2018&quot;</code> AND PLACE A README.MD FILE IN IT.</strong><br />
Create your first file called
<code>README.md</code> at the top level of the repository.  You can put whatever text you like in the file
(If you like, use something like <a href="https://lipsum.com/">lorem ipsum</a>
to generate random sentences to place in the file.).
Please include the link to <strong>your</strong> Github repository that now includes the minimal <code>README.md</code>.
You don&rsquo;t have to have anything elaborate in that file or the repo.</p>

<h3 id="0-explore-jupyterhub-linux-console-integrating-what-you-learned-in-the-prior-parts-of-this-homework">(0%) Explore JupyterHub Linux console integrating what you learned in the prior parts of this homework</h3>

<p>The Linux console in JupyterLab is a great way to perform command-line tasks and is an essential tool
for basic scripting that is part of a data scientist&rsquo;s toolkit.  Open a console in the lab environment
and familiarize yourself with your files and basic commands using git as indicated below.</p>

<ol>
<li>In a new JupyterLab command line console, run the <code>git clone</code> command to clone the new
repository you created in the prior part.
You will want to read the documentation on this
command (try here <a href="https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-clone">https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-clone</a> to get a good
start).</li>
<li>Within the same console, modify your <code>README.md</code> file, check it in and push it back to your repository, using
<code>git push</code>.  Read the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push">documentation about <code>git push</code></a>.</li>
<li>The commands <code>wget</code> and <code>curl</code> are useful for grabbing data and files from remote resources off the web.
Read the documentation on each of these commands by typing <code>man wget</code> or <code>man curl</code> in the terminal.
Make sure you pipe the output to a file or use the proper flags to do so.</li>
</ol>

<p>&#167;  <strong>THERE IS NOTHING TO TURN IN FOR THIS PART.</strong></p>

<h3 id="45-explore-python-for-basic-text-mining">(45%) Explore Python for basic text mining</h3>

<p>Python is one of the most important languages in contemporary data science right now.  Its strengths are in
readability and clarity of computational expressiveness.  There are a number of data science libraries and
modules that we will be using throughout the course to achieve many important outcomes with Python.</p>

<p>You will be tasked with writing two basic programs in Python using Jupyter Lab.  For starters,
here are a few recommended resources you are encouraged to use though you are free to use whatever
resources you find useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://python.org">Python website (https://python.org)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python-guide.org">Hitchhikers Guide to Python by Kenneth Reitz and Tanya Schlusser (https://docs.python-guide.org)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/">Think Python by Allen Downey (http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For the first part of the assignment, you will be tasked with a &ldquo;warm up&rdquo; tapping into the text processing
capabilities of Python.  Please turn in the code and answers according to the instructions.</p>

<p>&#167;  <strong>WRITE A PROGRAM IN YOUR JUPYTER NOTEBOOK TO KEEP TRACK OF THE FREQUENCY OF THE TOP 30 WORDS THAT END IN &ldquo;<em>ng</em>&ldquo;
FOR THE FOLLOWING 3 BOOKS:</strong></p>

<p>(<em>The top 30 should be sorted by descending frequency &ndash; most frequent to least.</em>)</p>

<ul>
<li>The Republic by Plato <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1497/pg1497.txt">http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1497/pg1497.txt</a></li>
<li>Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/996/pg996.txt">http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/996/pg996.txt</a></li>
<li>The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43/43-0.txt">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43/43-0.txt</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For this part we will be using the open and freely available
<a href="https://Gutenberg.org">Gutenberg.org</a>, which contains a large number of
books in the public domain available for reading (or whatever purpose).
We will just grab the text documents we would like to analyze and process them,
though you are welcome to hang out on Gutenberg and do some light evening
reading whenever you have free time.</p>

<p>To speed things up, you can store the documents
locally (grabbing them through <code>wget</code> or <code>curl</code>) or you can use the
boilerplate code provided below that
uses the <code>requests</code> library and loads the document files each time over the web.
If you store them locally, you are
still resposible for writing the code for reading and processing the documents. Either way, it is up to
you how you&rsquo;d like to craft your solution.</p>

<p>If you find it useful, you are welcome to read the documentation
for and use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/collections.html?highlight=counter#collections.Counter"><code>Counter</code></a> object that is part of the
Collections module.  While <code>Counter</code> may be useful, it is not required
and there is a solution without it that is equally elegant.  NOTE:
you should <strong>normalize the text</strong> so that all words are lowercase and free
of punctuation (commas, periods, dashes, semicolons, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>Do not use any other text processing libraries beyond those
provided within Python directly (the good news is that you won&rsquo;t
have to, but ask me if you have any doubts).</strong>  You also do not
need to do any stripping of text from the preamble, introductory
remarks, etc. from the documents. Process them as they are.</p>

<p>You will also find that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#str.split"><code>split()</code></a> is useful in
accomplishing tasks for this part, and the <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/"><code>requests</code></a>
library is useful for grabbing the text directly from Gutenberg.org
as shown in the demo code below, though you are free to use whatever
HTTP library (e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/urllib.html"><code>urllib</code></a>)
you like.  Finally, you can consider normalizing text with the
<a href="https://"><code>re</code></a> regular expressions library.  For example, you can
remove all <code>,</code> (comma) from a word with <code>re.sub(r',','','thus,')</code>.  To extend that
to all punctuation, read the documentation on character classes and
punctuation <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax">https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax</a>.</p>

<p>Your notebook should include the solution code and answers structured in a table like below:</p>

<h3 id="45-explore-python-for-data-munging-and-analysis-with-an-introduction-to-json-and-pandas">(45%) Explore Python for data munging and analysis, with an introduction to JSON and Pandas</h3>

<p>Python&rsquo;s strengths shine when tasked with data munging and analysis.  In this section we will be
working with a <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/">dataset from the City of Baltimore Parks division</a> which
maintains open, public datasets for all the public parks in the Baltimore area.  For the curious
[such datasets on public parks are plentiful]() and vary in quality and detail.</p>

<p><strong>Please familiarize yourself with the data here</strong>  :</p>

<p><a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/resource/4qnj-2zbc.json">https://data.baltimorecity.gov/resource/4qnj-2zbc.json</a></p>

<p>As you will notice the data is a JSON file.  If you are unfamiliar with JSON, please take a look at this
resource: <a href="https://json.org">the JSON specification</a>.</p>

<p>As you look at the data, you will notice that there are some key data missing, which will be important for
answering our data-related questions later.  Let&rsquo;s enumerate what those issues are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the original JSON file contains the name and address of the park, but <strong>there is no <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/geolocation">Geolocation</a> data
indicating the latitude and longitude of the park</strong>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>the original JSON file has no ZIP code for the park</strong> &ndash; the address is complete, but without a ZIP code
we will not be able to answer some critical questions later.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>You will need to complete the following tasks which involve data extraction and manipulation in Python as well as answering specific questions about the data.</strong></p>

<p>&#167;  <strong>WRITE THE CODE IN YOUR NOTEBOOK TO ENRICH THE JSON SO IT INCLUDES OUR MISSING DATA.</strong>  <em>You will need to perform the following steps</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>load the parks JSON file into memory</strong> using <code>requests</code> or  by loading
it directly from the file system,</li>
<li><strong>iterate over the parks addresses and lookup the ZIP, latitude and longitude</strong> using the census API,</li>
<li><strong>update the in-memory JSON parks data with the ZIP, latitude and longitude</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>store the new JSON file locally</strong> and name it <code>baltimore_parks_enriched.json</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>We indicated above that the latitude and longitude of the parks were missing, but that there is
an address.  Lucky for us, there are a host of free online APIs that allow us to fill in the
missing pieces. The first API we will use is called the <a href="https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/">Geocoder API</a>
provided by the US Census,
which allows us to query the API with a street address and get the
ZIP, latitude and longitude of that address (among other things).</p>

<p><strong>&gt;</strong> <em>Here is a code snippet you might like to study and use to craft your solution:</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># a sample address
addr = &quot;301 32nd St&quot;

CENSUS_GEO_ADDR_ENDPOINT = &quot;https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/locations/address&quot;
r = requests \
      .get(&quot;{}?street={}&amp;city=baltimore&amp;state=MD&amp;benchmark=9&amp;format=json&quot; \
      .format(CENSUS_GEO_ADDR_ENDPOINT, addr)

if r.status_code == 200:
  data = r.json()

  # grab the first matching result, we're pretty confident in the matching for this part
  data['result']['addressMatches'][0]

  # YOUR CODE TO EXTRACT/INSERT THE MATCHING DATA (e.g. ZIP, LAT, LON)
else:
   print(&quot;[warn] GET request did not return HTTP/200 (HTTP/{} returned instead&quot;.format(r.status_code))

</code></pre>

<p>Notice, we stored the output as a JSON object (<code>data = r.json()</code>).
You will need to familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/json.html"><code>json</code></a> library and
the <code>json</code> object.  Specifically, how JSON is transformed as a
Python dictionary allowing easy manipulation.  Look at an example usage
of the <code>json</code> library: <a href="https://docs.python-guide.org/scenarios/json/">https://docs.python-guide.org/scenarios/json/</a>.
There are also many other examples you can explore.</p>

<p>&#167;  <strong>USE PANDAS TO CONVERT THE JSON OBJECT TO A DATAFRAME AND ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Which zipcode has the largest <em>number</em> of parks?</li>
<li>Which zipcode has the largest <em>acreage</em> of parks?</li>
<li>How many acres of parks are in zipcode 21229?</li>
<li>What is the average acreage of parks in zipcode 21215?</li>
</ol>

<p>To answer these questions, you&rsquo;ll need to dive further into Pandas, which is
the standard tool in the Python data science stack for loading, manipulating,
transforming, analyzing and preparing data as input to other tools such as
<a href="http://www.numpy.org/">Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)</a>,
<a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html">SciKitLearn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)</a>,
<a href="http://www.nltk.org/">NLTK (http://www.nltk.org/)</a> and others.</p>

<p>For this assignment, you will only need to learn how to load and select data using Pandas.</p>

<p><strong>LOADING DATA</strong>
The core data structure in Pandas is the <code>DataFrame</code>.  You will need to visit
the Pandas documentation <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs">(http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs)</a>
to learn more about the library, but to help you along with a hint, read the
documentation on the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_json.html"><code>pandas.read_json()</code></a> method.</p>

<p><strong>SELECTING DATA</strong>
The <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html">tutorial here on indexing and selecting</a>
should be of great use in understanding how to index and select subsets of
the data to answer the questions.</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE CODE</strong></p>

<p><strong>&gt;</strong> <em>Here is example code that should give you clues about the structure
of your code for this part.</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import pandas as pd

df = pandas.read_json('your_json_file.json')

# code for question 1 ... and so on

</code></pre>

<p>&#167;  <strong>BUILD A   &ldquo;DISTANCE TABLE&rdquo; (WITH A PANDAS DATAFRAME) OF PARK DISTANCES
USING THE HAVERSINE FORMULA.</strong> <em>Your solution should:</em></p>

<ol>
<li>create and calculate a distance table from each park to one another,
so that <strong>for a given park</strong> you can <strong>compute the
distances to all other parks</strong>.  Your solution can just involve
the <code>(lat,lon)</code> for each park as a tuple. The
diagonal of your table will, of course, be zero
(the distance from the park to itself is 0).  The row and column labels
of the table need only be the index of the park in the prior exercise.</li>
</ol>

<p>To use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">Haversine formula</a>
to compute the distance (in miles) between lat/lon park pairs &ndash; study its
distance calculation given by:</p>

<p>$$
H_{d}\big((\varphi_1, \lambda_1), (\varphi_2, \lambda_2)\big) = 2r \arcsin \bigg(
\sqrt {
(\sin^2 \bigg(\frac{\varphi_2 - \varphi_1}{2} \bigg) +
\cos(\varphi_1)\cos(\varphi_2)\sin^2\bigg(\frac{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1}{2}\bigg)
}
\bigg)
$$</p>

<p>Where $\varphi$ represent the longitude and $\lambda$ the latitude for
two points $p_1 = (\varphi_1, \lambda_1)$ and $p_2 = (\varphi_2, \lambda_2)$,
where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the latitude and longitude of two parks.</p>

<p>You can write the Python for the Haversine function on your own or
you can integrate the one I have coded <a href="https://gist.github.com/kmsaumcis/4066b56ebbff3ea3b515f617622a8854">here</a>.
Just remember $r=3961$ and that you will need to convert the
degrees input (lat/lon) to radians, using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/math.html#math.radians"><code>math.radians</code></a>
function.  Your Haversine function should take two pairs of
lat/lon coordinates and return their distance in miles.</p>

<p>To create the table, you will simply load the park data from
the previous section, iterate over all park pairs
and compute the Haversine distance and appropriately update
the table by index. <strong>HINT:</strong> Simply implement this as
nested loop, though be patient with the execution time
since there are 275 parks (~75K distance pairs) and
the loop $O(n^2)$.</p>

<p>The final DataFame (table) will look like an
$n \times m$ matrix so that the $n$th row and $m$th column represent
the distance from park $n$ to park $m$ using the Haversine distance.</p>

<p><strong>HINT:</strong> Make sure you do not delete or alter the table from the
previous answer as you will need it to make reference to indices
of the park names to correctly answer the questions for this part.</p>

<p>Here is what your DataFrame will start to look like:</p>
